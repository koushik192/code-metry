// nthTenlyPrime(n)
// We will say that a number is “tenly” (a made-up term) if the digits of the 
// number add up to 10. So 1153 is tenly, but 153 is not. With this in mind, write 
// the function nthTenlyPrime(n) that takes a non-negative int n and returns the 
// nth number that is both tenly and prime. You should also write all the required 
// helper functions. The first several tenly primes are: 19, 37, 73, 109, 127…
